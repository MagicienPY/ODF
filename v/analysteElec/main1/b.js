Starting my role as Distribution Lead #SSA for Al Jazeera, I took some time to settle in and understand the lay of the land. I‚Äôm happy to report that I absolutely love it, especially the diversity of the team.\n\nOf course, there have been challenges along the way, but the leadership has been incredibly supportive, hands-on, and committed to ensuring I felt heard and valued. As the Sub-Saharan expert in my field, I‚Äôm grateful that my insights and contributions have been recognized.\n\nOver the past year, I‚Äôve had the privilege of representing Al Jazeera at numerous events across the continent and beyond, connecting with key stakeholders, sharing our story and onboarding new distribution partners. A recent highlight was attending the World Travel Market‚Äîa milestone that adds another feather to my cap.\n\nAnother standout moment has been meeting the AJ+ team, whose incredible work continues to push boundaries. Their commitment to going where young audiences are and creating impactful, relevant content is truly inspiring. It‚Äôs a great reminder of how innovation and creativity can shape the future of storytelling.\n\nHere‚Äôs a look back at some memorable moments from events I‚Äôve attended, including the joy of reconnecting with former colleagues.\n\nHere‚Äôs to more growth, collaboration, and exciting milestones ahead! \n\n#AlJazeera #Leadership #Growth #MediaSales #SubSaharanAfrica #WorldTravelMarket #Networking #AJPlus #Innovation",

          "text": "‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the plan?‚Äù That was a question I was repeatedly asked when I announced my departure from the BBC a year ago. \n\nMy plan was to take a much needed sabbatical after 21 years working in news.\nI spent a significant part of it learning. I returned to school and acquired new skills in strategic digital communications, as well as AI marketing.\nBut I also didn‚Äôt close the doors that opened in the form of consultancy opportunities. \n\nI‚Äôve spent the last two decades navigating the successes and challenges of bringing African stories to global audiences.¬†\nBut I‚Äôve also seen the gaps, the challenges and the opportunities especially when it comes to telling our stories with both authenticity, and nuance. I‚Äôve witnessed the struggle by media houses to stay relevant amid disrupted business models, shifting audience habits, and digital transformation driven by technological advances.\n\nIt‚Äôs an exciting challenge- one that inspired me to set up Reebo Consult to help organisations navigate the evolving media and communications landscape. This is now the plan!\n\nWhether you‚Äôre launching a new initiative, refining an existing one, or integrating AI and modern workflows, we offer strategic advice to help you thrive in today‚Äôs complex media environment.\n\nI‚Äôm deeply excited by this opportunity to continue shaping narratives, empowering clients, and training a new generation of journalists, editorial leaders and communication professionals across Africa. \n\nI‚Äôm grateful to the organisations that have so far engaged Reebo Consult, including ATAF,¬†M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res, BBC Media Action, Global Media Congress, the JSK, Aga Khan University, and several others. I‚Äôm also grateful to my partners and experts.\n\nHere‚Äôs to the next chapter, one that I hope will be as transformative and impactful as the journey that brought me here.\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for a partner in media and editorial strategy, training, communications, storytelling, Reebo Consult is here and ready to collaborate. Feel free to reach out.\n\nAnd yes - Reebo Consult now has a company LinkedIn page. Give us a follow and let‚Äôs chat.",

As David Axelrod, Obama's campaign strategist put it, I got \"tired of chasing people down hallways to ask questions I already knew the answers to.\"\n\nEnter Chevening Awards. I applied. I got in. I went to the University of Glasgow to study Political Communication and this helped my pivot to the field of Development Communications, which has been loads of fun.  \n\nAll that to say the applications for the 2025-2026 Chevening Awards are now open. A fully paid, one year Masters opportunity at a UK university of your choosing.\n\nI highly recommend those who are looking to do a postgraduate degree to consider it. My time in the UK was absolutely amazing. The beauty of a Chevening Scholarship is that you can study what you like and almost anywhere in the UK. There's also no age limit to applicants, so if you are early, mid or late career and looking to expand your knowledge base or skillset, click the link below and throw your hat in the race.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/dS7sDwZZ",

          "text": "It's quite funny to see myself in the new BBC Group Annual Report... but it's made me reflect on what an awesome, challenging and exciting year and a half I've had career-wise. From being a Journalist with the World Service, to covering the 2023 Nigeria elections as a Senior Reporter to getting a permanent Senior (On-Air) Journalist role with the BBC News Channel and now doing a placement as a Foreign Correspondent in West Africa. \nI'm very grateful for the chance to be able to grow as a storytelller at an organisation that priorities career progression and have to give much credit to conscientious leaders like Stewart Maclean, Paul Royall, Magnus McGrandle, Joshua Ajayi, Harriet Oliver and Julie Taylor whom I've been opportuned to work with. I've been blessed that, recently, I have not found supportive management hard to come by. \nIt's equally sad to read the news of the 500 job cuts and the fact that the BBC \"registered a real-term fall in income of close to a third since 2010 ‚Äî a difference of more than ¬£1bn a year\", but encouraging that despite the financial challenges, the corporation will continue to prioritise employee satisfaction, through whatever means it is able to, and for the ambitious, in my experience, that could easily begin with the 80/20 scheme. \n\n(All this to say - apply for schemes at your workplace, you never know where it'll lead you!)",

The fast-paced environment and the quick turnaround of stories have been both challenging and rewarding.\n\nWorking alongside talented colleagues from MENA, the Indian subcontinent, Asia Pacific, the Americas, Europe, and our hub at New Broadcasting House in London has been a fantastic experience. The collaboration and shared expertise have been invaluable.\n\nStay tuned!",
